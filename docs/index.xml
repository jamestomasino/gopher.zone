 This document will give you a few hints about publishing through gopher. Line length =========== The rendering of content is client specific. However most clients will present the user with a text based interface, so you should be conservative on the maximum line length in your menus. As clients will add a couple of characters to mark item types, a line width of 69 characters is recommended.</description>

 From: dbucklin@sdf.org Date: 2018-03-31 Subject: How to Gopher In principal, publishing a Gopher site should be easy. And it *is* easy, assuming you are willing to put in some effort. At minimum, you need to find someone who is already operating a Gopher server, find out how to get access to the server, and then create, orga- nize, and upload your content. At most, you need to set up a gopher server -- not just the daemon, but set up a server or VPS with the appropriate operating system.</description>

WHAT IS GOPHER AND GOPHERSPACE? GOPHER is a network protocol that enables multiple servers to create a single, uniform filesystem that transcends system architecure and operating systems (GOPHERSPACE). With GOPHER, information holds the most value. Since presentation is uniform across GOPHERSPACE, the user does not encounter any challenges in &amp;lsquo;learning&amp;rsquo; a new site. Because of its simplicity and its emphasis on the importance of informational texts, GOPHER is ideal for those who are visually impared.</description>

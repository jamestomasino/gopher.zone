      <description>This is a collection of posts about what makes gopher special.

Sean Tilly (someone I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet) has asked on mastodon about the recurring mentions of gopher and what&amp;rsquo;s so special about it. This got me thinking and these are my reasons why I think gopher is interesting:
It is simple: There are no fancy frameworks to learn, the programs needed to run for hosting gopher yourself is tiny compared to other things on the internet.</description>

Gophernicus is quite fussy about permissions, to minimise the risk of accidentally serving files not intended for public consumptions. Only world accessible content will be served, so chmod files o+r and directories o+rw. This is a common cause of confusion and frustration for beginners.
Gophernicus supports so-called &amp;ldquo;personal gopherspaces&amp;rdquo;. If a user &amp;ldquo;bob&amp;rdquo; has a directory named &amp;ldquo;public_gopher&amp;rdquo; in their home directory, then the file /home/bob/public_gopher/foo/bar/baz.</description>

This document will give you a few hints about publishing through gopher.
Line length The rendering of content is client specific. However most clients will present the user with a text based interface, so you should be conservative on the maximum line length in your menus. As clients will add a couple of characters to mark item types, a line width of 69 characters is recommended.</description>

 From: dbucklin@sdf.org Date: 2018-03-31 Subject: How to Gopher In principal, publishing a Gopher site should be easy. And it *is* easy, assuming you are willing to put in some effort. At minimum, you need to find someone who is already operating a Gopher server, find out how to get access to the server, and then create, orga- nize, and upload your content. At most, you need to set up a gopher server -- not just the daemon, but set up a server or VPS with the appropriate operating system.</description>

The article in this content is specific to setting up a gopher hole on SDF (The Super Dimensional Fortress) Public Access Unix System. Visit sdf.org for more information on how to create an account.
This document was written with &amp;lsquo;mkgopher&amp;rsquo; in mind. You may be managing your space from the UNIX shell, but since &amp;lsquo;mkgopher&amp;rsquo; uses common UNIX commands, this should still be helpful.</description>

      <description>Original published by SDF at gopher://sdf.org:70/1/sdf/faq/GOPHER
GOPHER is a network protocol that enables multiple servers to create a single, uniform filesystem that transcends system architecure and operating systems (GOPHERSPACE). With GOPHER, information holds the most value. Since presentation is uniform across GOPHERSPACE, the user does not encounter any challenges in &amp;lsquo;learning&amp;rsquo; a new site. Because of its simplicity and its emphasis on the importance of informational texts, GOPHER is ideal for those who are visually impared.</description>

# Highway to the Gopher.Zone

This is a minimal static-site-generated blog of write-ups and
resources for new users who are new to gopher. In a sense, the
articles here can be thought of as a gopher kickstart.

## Additions

Do you have content that should be shared here? Either notify me
in an issue or add the content directly via pull request. If the
content is originally from another source, please replicate it
here, but include a preamble to the article with a link to the
original.

## Duplication

Links on the web and in gopher can disappear, so this
repository/blog chooses to replicate the content rather than link
to it.

## Build from Source

This repo uses submodules for the theme. To properly clone the
repository you should run:

    git clone --recurse-submodules <path to repo>

You'll need to install `hugo` to build the project, but once done
you can run the local testing server as so:

    make serve

## Copyright

If your content is duplicated/linked to here and you don't want it
to be so, please notify me via an issue or email and I'll promptly
remove it.

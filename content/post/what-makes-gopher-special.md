Sean Tilly (someone I don't know yet) has asked on [mastodon][] about
the recurring mentions of gopher and what's so special about it. This
got me thinking and these are my reasons why I think gopher is
interesting:

It is simple: There are no fancy frameworks to learn, the programs
needed to run for hosting gopher yourself is tiny compared to other
things on the internet.

Because it is simple and way off the mainstream it encourages a do
it yourself attitude. Almost nobody is a consumer of some 'publishing'
platform, everyone is making it up as they go. And for the people
that keep on using it you can see a lot of unique and different
styles in creating and presenting content.

So not only in terms of protocols, complexity and software but also
in the mindset of its current users, gopher is the anti-thesis to
the 'commercial' web.

This kind of like feels a lot like when people started typing out
HTML pages manually and experimenting with linking styles, how to
communicate with others etc.

Gopher is still a lot simpler than that though, kind of like the
web how it could have been for people.

So, I ask you, dear reader: What does gopher mean to you?

### On the specialness of gopher (reply to ckeen)

Personally, I love and use gopher for the following reasons:

- It is clean -- no ads, no bullshit
- It is fast -- text screams over the network
- The citizens are also the creators -- not passive
- High signal to noise ratio
- As a on-and-off-again Linux user for the past 20 years, I have learned so much from setting up my server and reading phlog posts. I find it a truly valuable resource. (I mainly run FreeBSD now, gopher led me to it)

Ancient tools and utilities have become daily use items, and I like the people. I may disagree with a lot of the politics, but it is not so polarized on gopher that it causes a division. The general lack of comments helps this. A live-and-let-live atmosphere pervades.

Thats what makes gopher special to me in a nutshell.

ckeen recently wrote about what makes gopher special to him.
He and jynx nail it pretty well when they talk about the
simplicity, creator/consumer dynamic, and signal to noise ratio.
I like the intentionality of it all as well. You don't just
accidentally create a gopher hole. You didn't just click a link to
oAuth somewhere and start posting nonsense. You chose to create an
account somewhere that offered a gopher server, or you rolled your
own. You sat there with the text editor crafting your message.
It's simple, yes, but it's also much more complicated.

In a sense, the technology itself and its relatively esoteric and
retro nature create a sort of gatekeeper. Gatekeeping is generally
used in a negative connotation these days, but I think this type of
natural systems gatekeeping is different. It's not prejudiced
against a people or person for identity, but for intent, will, and
interest. The technology hurdles aren't that high to say you have
to be a coder to make it work. Cat, for instance, has one of
the prettiest gopher holes and he does everything by hand using
the simplest tools. In place of fancy coding proficiency he has
demonstrated excellent interest and will to build Fax Sex.

I love nerdy communities when they're seething with excitement and
intention. I hate nerdy communities when they're filled with
criticism, angst, and envy. Gopher satisfies the first group well
and avoids the second. Perhaps it is as jynx says, a side effect
of no comments. Perhaps it's just the community by chance. Maybe
it's a side effect of the manual execution? You can't do
a drive-by trolling on gopher, after all. Once you sink in the
time to get set up, you're part of things.

At the end of the day, I guess it all boils down to content.
There's a lot of people on here that are doing interesting things.
Sometimes it's computer related and sometimes not, but that
exceptional drive to "do" things is contagious and I love it.
